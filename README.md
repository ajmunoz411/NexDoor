# NexDoor
A neighborhood help network.

## Description
Nexdoor allows users to request and offer help for tasks from neighbors in their area (ex: help moving a couch, need some flour, etc). A map and main feed displays open tasks in the area, which a user can claim if they'd like to assist. Once they're confirmed by the requester, the helper and requester can message one another for further details. After completion of a task, the requester can rate their helper and leave comments.
